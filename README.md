# HTML5-Game for a school project (WIP!)

This game is made for a project on school. This game uses the Phaser Game engine and is mainly coded in typescript which is compiled to javascript. All the compiled javascript is in the generated.js file, which is located in the root folder.

I also made my own algorithm for combining small squares in a grid map into a bigger body. Example: http://jimvliet.github.io/HTML5-Game/objectConverter
